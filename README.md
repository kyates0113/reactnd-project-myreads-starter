# MyReads Project

This app will allow you to search for books and add them to shelves according to what you "want to read", "have read", or "are reading". 


## Running the project

To get started - run:
git clone https://github.com/kyates0113/reactnd-project-myreads-starter.git

After cloning:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

Compatible with google chrome and firefox. 

## Important

The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
